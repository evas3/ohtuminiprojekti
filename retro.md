Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel
Retrospective tactic of our project group is to have a discussion where.

Time of retrospective 11DEC23 14:00.

Start: 
- Testing and linting before pushing!
- Checking requirements more often.

Stop:
- Pushing before testing!

Continue:
- Good communication on changes!
- At least a small amount of work being done together every week 

More Of:
- Good communication
- Distrubute work evenly during the week

Less Of:
- Coding marathons

Improvement suggestions:
  - Change of development process to remember to test and lint changes before pushing to main, thus avoiding unnecessary breaking of the main branch in CI/CD pipeline. 
  - Having a requirements meeting before the end of sprint, preferably with some workhours still available to fix issues.
